# Caption + Face Eval Harness (VLM-2A)

Scores generated image descriptions (deterministic tier, assessment §6c tiers
1–2, 5–6) and face-recognition P/R (detection + identification, micro +
per-identity macro) against the 38-image golden manifest. Runs on the laptop;
**all inference happens on the remote OCI service** (concurrency 1).

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Fixtures (59 MB, not vendored): see scene/tests/seed/README.md
export GOLDEN_IMAGES_DIR=~/Development/eval-fixtures

# 2. Dedicated eval tenant — NEVER the demo tenant. Mint via /admin console.
export ACX_EVAL_LIVE=1                    # safety gate for live subcommands
export ACX_EVAL_BASE_URL=https://api.altcontext.com
export ACX_EVAL_API_KEY=<eval-tenant key>
export ACX_EVAL_TENANT_ID=<eval tenant UUID>   # seed-roster only
```

## Usage

```bash
cd apps/prototype-description-service   # load-bearing: repo root has a different scripts/

# one-time: seed the eval tenant (idempotent — safe to re-run)
uv run python -m scripts.eval_harness.cli seed-roster --entities "$GOLDEN_IMAGES_DIR/mock_entities"

# full run (fetch + score); or from repo root: make eval-captions
uv run python -m scripts.eval_harness.cli run

# smoke: 3 images
uv run python -m scripts.eval_harness.cli run --limit 3

# offline re-score of a recorded run (deterministic; bit-identical check)
uv run python -m scripts.eval_harness.cli score --run-record scripts/eval_harness/out/run-<stamp>.json --check-determinism
```

## Artifacts and retention

- Run records + reports land in `scripts/eval_harness/out/` (git-ignored),
  pruned keep-last-N (default 10, `--keep`).
- `out/ignore-list.json` (`{"wrong_names": [["<path>", "<name>"], ...]}`)
  suppresses triaged wrong-name false positives across runs; ignored entries
  are still reported under `ignored_wrong_names`. Never pruned.
- Curated baselines are promoted by hand to `docs/tasks/vlm/`.

## Report schema (`acx-eval/v1`, E19-1 extension)

JSON sections: `provenance` (manifest sha256, base_url, HEAD sha, started_at),
`counts`, `caption` (insertion_rate, Must-Right failed images, policy
violations, mean gated score), `faces.detection` (count-based P/R),
`faces.identification` (micro + macro P/R, per-identity table, wrong_names
listed individually, true_rejections, excluded policy-disabled images),
`per_image`, `failures`. Deterministic sections are bit-identical across
re-scores of the same run record.

## Failure semantics (rg-007)

Per-image failures are recorded and the run continues; `--stall-limit`
(default 5) consecutive failures aborts non-zero. The HTTP client adds a
3-strike circuit breaker and bounded job polling.

## LLM-judge tier

`--llm-judge` is a stub flag only (fails fast). Tiers 3–4 of §6c are out of
this MVP.
